# Overwiew
This project analyzes data on movies released over the past 30 years to discern the best way for Microsoft to start their new movie studio. We will be looking at data pulled from movie databases IMdB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Box Office Mojo. This will provide us with key metrics for analyzing valuable data points such as movie budget, domestic and international gross, and user rating scores. Microsoft can use this information to formulate a stategy for the best way to enter the movie industry. 

# Business Problem
There are three key issues that must be faced to understand how Microsoft can best enter and excell in this business space. Firstly, we must look at which movies have been sucessful at the box office. This will tell us what types of movies consumers are interested in seeing. Next we can use Return on Investment (ROI) values to analyze movies that have been profitable. We can define ROI as the Total Gross of the movie divided by the Movie Budget and multiplied by 100 (Total Gross/Budget)* 100. Lastly, we can analyse the components of ROI, Gross and Budget, to get a sense of the relationship between profit and expense to see how much Microsoft should commit to a project. 

# Results
"Adventure, Fantasy" movies have had the largest average gross at the box office.

Movies with the highest ROI are not the highest rated movies. Movies in the 6-8 range have the highest ceiling for ROI.

There is a positive correlation between Gross and Budget, as the budget increases the gross tends to be larger. Movies with high budgets have large grosses and typically have positive ROIs yet they have the *highest* ROI. In fact high ROI is more closesly related to lower budget movies.

Microsoft will need to make sure that they pay attention to the consumer information. The data is telling us that movie goers like to watch "Adventure,Fantasy", "Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi", and "Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi" films. As well it is saying that the majority of revenue for the movies comes from international markets. This tells us that Microsoft should consider making an Adventure Genre movie for their first film as well as targeting potention viewers outside of the United States. Further Microsoft will need to be prepared to commit money to this project. As we have seen in order to have a higher change of securing a healthy ROI a larger budget will be required. Finally, Microsoft should focus on a movie that appeals to a broad audience. As we can see from the IMdB Data, users prefer movies that are in the 4-6 user rating range. This is evident as those movies have the highest ROI values. Microsoft should work to create a movie in this criteria, with mass appead in both content and genre.
